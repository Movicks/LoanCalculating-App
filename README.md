## Code Explanation

### HTML (`index.html`)

The HTML file contains the structure of the web page, including input fields for the loan amount, interest rate, and years to repay, as well as sections to display the results and any error messages.

### CSS (`app.css`)

The CSS file contains styles for the web page, ensuring a clean and user-friendly design. It includes styles for the container, form elements, loader, and result display.

### JavaScript (`app.js`)

The JavaScript file contains the functionality of the loan calculator. It listens for the form submission, performs the loan calculations, and updates the UI with the results. It also handles showing and hiding the loader animation and displaying error messages for invalid input.
